- 👋 Hi, I’m @Noc662
- 👀 I’m interested in learning some development not for a job or anything like that, but more for a personal goal.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend development..html, css, and javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I don't know enough to actually collaborate with anyone.
